Balloon TV
==========

This is a little project for adding an ATTiny 85 to a Commtech Video transmitter in order
to get it to transmit it on 1252MHz, and send out a CW (morse code) identifier on the 
audio channels. The transmitter is a quick and simple solution for the annual Dutch
Balloon Fox Hunt called [Landelijke Ballonvossenjacht](http://www.ballonvossenjacht.nl/)

Information on how to build your own can be found in the [documentation/how-to-build.md](development guide).
Datasheets of all the used hardware can be found in the [datasheets directory](documentation/datasheets).

A brief timeline with notes and funny stories can be found in the [project diary](documentation/diary.md).
I'll try to keep it updated with the latest info as much as possible.
