Notes

Install ITTiny library into Arduino IDE from 
code.google arduino-tiny

In the IDE, load the  Arduino ISP sketch and upload it to an UNO.

On the UNO, connect 10uF over reset/gnd. Then connect:
- 5v to pin 8 of the ATTiny
- GND to pin 4
- pin 10 to pin 1 (reset)
- pin 11 to pin 5
- pin 12 to pin 6
- pin 13 to pin 7

In the Arduino IDE, select the attiny 8MHz as board.
Select arduino as ISP as programmer.
Burn boatloader onto the attiny.

Check high-low tech for board manager links

In Arduino 1.6.9, the board URLs are in the settings. Add the URL there. Then go to the board manager and install the attiny manager. Select Board ATTiny, Processor AT85 and clock 8MHz from the Tools menu in the IDE. The bottom right of the screen should now read "ATTiny 24/45/85, ATTiny85, Internal 8MHz on /dev/..."

I2C library for ATtiny
http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/USIi2c

The I2C connections are pretty straight forward:
    Arduino SDA <— 4.7k Resistor Tied to 5v —-> ATtiny 85 – PB0
    Arduino SCL <— 4.7k Resistor Tied to 5v —-> ATtiny 85 – PB3
    ATtiny 85 – PB1 <— 330 Resistor —- LED —- > GND
