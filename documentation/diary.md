The project diary
=================

The [2016 diary is here](diary-2016.md)

A list of funny notes and events of what happens on the project in 2017:

- June/July: New plans! In an attempt to return to an actual radio direction finding event,
  the balloon needs to be ligther. Research is done to accomplish that. A lighter camera is
  one of the changes which might impact the balloon TV transmitter.
- 18 July: At the first organisation meeting the TV transmitter returns back to my desk,
  with a request to see if we make more improvements to the temperature stability. A can
  of freeze spray is on its way, because our freezer only goes to -22 degrees centigrade.
  Frank, our ATV expert is contacted to help with finding a solution to this problem. The
  important requirement is that it can not cost extra power or weight.
